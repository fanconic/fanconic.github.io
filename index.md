Hi, I am Claudio! I'm an M. Sc. student at ETH Zürich studying Information Technology and Electrical Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning (ML). I conducted my Master's thesis at Stanford in biomedical informatics on predictive uncertainty and natural language processing for identifying patients at risk of acute care. I am passionate about (i) ML applied to high-stakes environment such as medicine, (ii) uncertainty estimation with Bayesian models, and (iii) interpretability of modern deep learning architectures. Besides, I have also worked on few projects involving variational networks for image registration, multi-task learning for autonomous driving, and risk predictions based on BERT models.

Before starting my Master's, I interned as a machine learning engineer at IBM and as a management consultant at McKinsey & Company. Previously, I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, also at ETH Zürich.
